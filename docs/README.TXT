MapCollaborator NG2014
TEMPLATE EDITION

This MapCollaborator instance may be used as a template and instructions for
starting up your own MapCollaborator instance for a client. Emphasis in design was placed
on flexibility and configurability, based on lessons learned from the dozen-or-so MC instances
using the older codebase.

MapCollaborator NG2014 is based on GIN Bootstrap.

* CodeIgniter, the web service framework for PHP, with starter behaviors including
    login authentication, logout, and controller-level authorization
* A starter database with PostGIS 2.0, and tables for storing vector features
* DataMapper ORM, an object-oriented ORM which works well with CodeIgniter
* jQuery and jQuery UI, which make all things possible

All of these components are well documented at their own websites. Ask Google.
